## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This bot is written in python and imports aria2 for downloading files and magnet links and uploads to google drive via drive-cli then returns direct download/share link with visibility set to public for easy sharing.

## üé• Demo / Working <a name = "demo"></a>

Will be updated shortly!

## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first extracts the link from the the command it's called from and then adds it to aria2 cli via webhooks, after that it will show progress every 2 seconds in form of message updates.

Once the download completes it will then proceed to upload the file/folder using predefined scripts that will then return the shared link in form of a reply to the original message.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.7

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

To use the bot, type:

```
/help
```
or

```
/start (personal message only)
```

All commands, i.e. "/help" **are not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the help context menu.

### Start:

> /help

**Response:**

**/mirror**  :for http(s),ftp and file downloads

**/magnet**  :for torrent magnet links

**/cancel**  :cancel all in progress downloads

**/list**    :get a list of downloads

use these commands along with your link or magnets.

### Example:

```
/mirror https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso
```
